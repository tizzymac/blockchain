## Wee blockchain
### Just experimenting :)
A simple blockchain that records transactions and allows new blocks to be mined using a basic proof of work algorithm. It's decentralized and can support multiple nodes using a consensus algorithm.

Fire up the server and then I used Postman to interact with the API over a network. Otherwise just use cURL.
Eg. Mine a block by making a GET request to http://localhost:1917/mine
